## Getting started

### Create a facade

_Important note_: **Please, do NOT import anything from the `/dist/lib` package.** This is unsupported and might break any time.

1. Create an instance of `MonitoringFacade`, which is the main entrypoint.
1. Call methods on the facade like `.monitorLambdaFunction()` and chain them together to define your monitors. You can also use methods to add your own widgets, headers of various sizes, and more.

For examples of monitoring different resources, refer to [the unit tests](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-monitoring-constructs/tree/main/test/monitoring).

```ts
export interface MonitoringStackProps extends DeploymentStackProps {
  // ...
}

// This could be in the same stack as your resources, as a nested stack, or a separate stack as you see fit
export class MonitoringStack extends DeploymentStack {
  constructor(parent: App, name: string, props: MonitoringStackProps) {
    super(parent, name, props);

    const monitoring = new MonitoringFacade(this, "Monitoring", {
      // Defaults are provided for these, but they can be customized as desired
      metricFactoryDefaults: { ... },
      alarmFactoryDefaults: { ... },
      dashboardFactory: { ... },
    });

    // Monitor your resources
    monitoring
      .addLargeHeader("Storage")
      .monitorDynamoTable({ /* Monitor a DynamoDB table */ })
      .monitorDynamoTable({ /* and a different table */ })
      .monitorLambdaFunction({ /* and a Lambda function */ })
      .monitorCustom({ /* and some arbitrary metrics in CloudWatch */ })
      // ... etc.
  }
}
```

### Customize actions

Alarms should have an action setup, otherwise they are not very useful. Currently, we support notifying an SNS topic.

```ts
const onAlarmTopic = new Topic(this, "AlarmTopic");

const monitoring = new MonitoringFacade(this, "Monitoring", {
  // ...other props
  alarmFactoryDefaults: {
    // ....other props
    action: new SnsAlarmActionStrategy({ onAlarmTopic }),
  },
});
```

You can override the default topic for any alarm like this:

```ts
monitoring
  .monitorSomething(something, {
    addSomeAlarm: {
      Warning: {
        // ...other props
        threshold: 42,
        actionOverride: new SnsAlarmActionStrategy({ onAlarmTopic }),
      }
    }
  });
```

### Custom metrics

For simply adding some custom metrics, you can use `.monitorCustom()` and specify your own title and metric groups.
Each metric group will be rendered as a single graph widget, and all widgets will be placed next to each other.
All the widgets will have the same size, which is chosen based on the number of groups to maximize dashboard space usage.

Custom metric monitoring can be created for simple metrics, simple metrics with anomaly detection and search metrics.
The first two also support alarming.

Below we are listing a couple of examples. Let us assume that there are three existing metric variables: `m1`, `m2`, `m3`.
They can either be created by hand (`new Metric({...})`) or (preferably) by using `metricFactory` (that can be obtained from facade).
The advantage of using the shared `metricFactory` is that you do not need to worry about period, etc.

```ts
// create metrics manually
const m1 = new Metric(/* ... */);
```

```ts
const metricFactory = monitoringFacade.createMetricFactory();

// create metrics using metric factory
const m1 = metricFactory.createMetric(/* ... */);
```

#### Example: metric with anomaly detection

In this case, only one metric is supported.
Multiple metrics cannot be rendered with anomaly detection in a single widget due to a CloudWatch limitation.

```ts
monitorCustom({
  title: "Metric with anomaly detection",
  metrics: [
    {
      metric: m1,
      anomalyDetectionStandardDeviationToRender: 3
    }
  ]
})
```

Adding an alarm:

```ts
monitorCustom({
  title: "Metric with anomaly detection and alarm",
  metrics: [
    {
      metric: m1,
      alarmFriendlyName: "MetricWithAnomalyDetectionAlarm",
      anomalyDetectionStandardDeviationToRender: 3,
      addAlarmOnAnomaly: {
        Warning: {
          standardDeviationForAlarm: 4,
          alarmWhenAboveTheBand: true,
          alarmWhenBelowTheBand: true
        }
      }
    }
  ]
})
```

#### Example: search metrics

```ts
monitorCustom({
  title: "Metric search",
  metrics: [
    {
      searchQuery: "My.Prefix.",
      dimensionsMap: {
        FirstDimension: "FirstDimensionValue",
        // Allow any value for the given dimension (pardon the weird typing to satisfy DimensionsMap)
        SecondDimension: undefined as unknown as string
      }
      statistic: MetricStatistic.SUM,
    }
  ]
})
```

Search metrics do not support setting an alarm, which is a CloudWatch limitation.

### Route53 Health Checks

Route53 has [strict requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-types.html) as to which alarms are allowed to be referenced in Health Checks.
You adjust the metric for an alarm so that it can be used in a Route53 Health Checks as follows:

```ts
monitoring
  .monitorSomething(something, {
    addSomeAlarm: {
      Warning: {
        // ...other props
        metricAdjuster: Route53HealthCheckMetricAdjuster.INSTANCE,
      }
    }
  });
```

This will ensure the alarm can be used on a Route53 Health Check or otherwise throw an `Error` indicating why the alarm can't be used.
In order to easily find your Route53 Health Check alarms later on, you can apply a custom tag to them as follows:

```ts
import { CfnHealthCheck } from "aws-cdk-lib/aws-route53";

monitoring
  .monitorSomething(something, {
    addSomeAlarm: {
      Warning: {
        // ...other props
        customTags: ["route53-health-check"],
        metricAdjuster: Route53HealthCheckMetricAdjuster.INSTANCE,
      }
    }
  });

const alarms = monitoring.createdAlarmsWithTag("route53-health-check");

const healthChecks = alarms.map(({ alarm }) => {
  const id = getHealthCheckConstructId(alarm);

  return new CfnHealthCheck(scope, id, {
    healthCheckConfig: {
      // ...other props
      type: "CLOUDWATCH_METRIC",
      alarmIdentifier: {
        name: alarm.alarmName,
        region: alarm.stack.region,
      },
    },
  });
});
```

### Custom monitoring segments

If you want even more flexibility, you can create your own segment.

This is a general procedure on how to do it:

1. Extend the `Monitoring` class
1. Override the `widgets()` method (and/or similar ones)
1. Leverage the metric factory and alarm factory provided by the base class (you can create additional factories, if you will)
1. Add all alarms to `.addAlarm()` so they are visible to the user and being placed on the alarm summary dashboard

Both of these monitoring base classes are dashboard segments, so you can add them to your monitoring by calling `.addSegment()` on the `MonitoringFacade`.

### Modifying or omitting widgets from default dashboard segments

While the dashboard widgets defined in the library are meant to cover most use cases, they might not be what you're looking for.

To modify the widgets:

1. Extend the appropriate `Monitoring` class (e.g., `LambdaFunctionMonitoring` for `monitorLambdaFunction`) and override the relevant methods (e.g., `widgets`):
    ```ts
    export class MyCustomizedLambdaFunctionMonitoring extends LambdaFunctionMonitoring {
      widgets(): IWidget[] {
        return [
          // Whatever widgets you want instead of what LambdaFunctionMonitoring has
        ];
      }
    }
    ```
1. Use the facade's `addSegment` method with your custom class:
    ```ts
    declare const facade: MonitoringFacade;

    facade.addSegment(new MyCustomizedLambdaFunctionMonitoring(facade, {
      // Props for LambdaFunctionMonitoring
    }));
    ```

### Custom dashboards

If you want *even* more flexibility, you can take complete control over dashboard generation by leveraging dynamic dashboarding features. This allows you to create an arbitrary number of dashboards while configuring each of them separately. You can do this in three simple steps:

1. Create a dynamic dashboard factory
2. Create `IDynamicDashboardSegment` implementations
3. Add Dynamic Segments to your `MonitoringFacade`

#### Create a dynamic dashboard factory

The below code sample will generate two dashboards with the following names:
* ExampleDashboards-HostedService
* ExampleDashboards-Infrastructure


```ts
// create the dynamic dashboard factory.
const factory = new DynamicDashboardFactory(stack, "DynamicDashboards", {
  dashboardNamePrefix: "ExampleDashboards",
  dashboardConfigs: [
    // 'name' is the minimum required configuration
    { name: "HostedService" },
    // below is an example of additional dashboard-specific config options
    {
      name: "Infrastructure",
      range: Duration.hours(3),
      periodOverride: PeriodOverride.AUTO,
      renderingPreference: DashboardRenderingPreference.BITMAP_ONLY
    },
  ],
});
```

#### Create `IDynamicDashboardSegment` implementations
For each construct you want monitored, you will need to create an implementation of an `IDynamicDashboardSegment`. The following is a basic reference implementation as an example:

```ts
export enum DashboardTypes {
  HostedService = "HostedService",
  Infrastructure = "Infrastructure",
}

class ExampleSegment implements IDynamicDashboardSegment {
  widgetsForDashboard(name: string): IWidget[] {
    // this logic is what's responsible for allowing your dynamic segment to return
    // different widgets for different dashboards
    switch (name) {
      case DashboardTypes.HostedService:
        return [new TextWidget({ markdown: "This shows metrics for your service hosted on AWS Infrastructure" })];
      case DashboardTypes.Infrastructure:
        return [new TextWidget({ markdown: "This shows metrics for the AWS Infrastructure supporting your hosted service" })];
      default:
        throw new Error("Unexpected dashboard name!");
    }
  }
}
```

#### Add Dynamic Segments to MonitoringFacade

When you have instances of an `IDynamicDashboardSegment` to use, they can be added to your dashboard like this:

```ts
monitoring.addDynamicSegment(new ExampleSegment());
```

Now, this widget will be added to both dashboards and will show different content depending on the dashboard. Using the above example code, two dashboards will be generated with the following content:

* Dashboard Name: "ExampleDashboards-HostedService"
  * Content: "This shows metrics for your service hosted on AWS Infrastructure"
* Dashboard Name: "ExampleDashboards-Infrastructure"
  * Content: "This shows metrics for the AWS Infrastructure supporting your hosted service"

### Cross-account cross-Region Dashboards

Facades can be configured for different regions/accounts as a whole:

```ts
new MonitoringFacade(stack, "Monitoring", {
  metricFactoryDefaults: {
    // Different region/account than what you're deploying to
    region: "us-west-2",
    account: "01234567890",
  }
});
```

Or at a more granular level:

```ts
monitoring
  .monitorDynamoTable({
    // Table from the same account/region
    table: Table.fromTableName(stack, "ImportedTable", "MyTableName"),
  })
  .monitorDynamoTable({
    // Table from another account/region
    table: Table.fromTableArn(
      stack,
      "XaXrImportedTable",
      "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:01234567890:table/my-other-table",
    ),
    region: "us-west-2",
    account: "01234567890",
  });
```

The order of precedence of the region/account values is:

1. The individual metric factory's props (e.g. via the `monitorDynamoTable` props).
1. The facade's `metricFactoryDefaults` props.
1. The region/account that the stack is deployed to.

Note that while this allows for cross-account cross-Region dashboarding, cross-Region alarming is not supported by CloudWatch.

### Monitoring scopes

You can monitor complete CDK construct scopes using an aspect. It will automatically discover all monitorable resources within the scope recursively and add them to your dashboard.

```ts
monitoring.monitorScope(stack, {
  // With optional configuration
  lambda: {
    props: {
      addLatencyP50Alarm: {
        Critical: { maxLatency: Duration.seconds(10) },
      },
    },
  },

  // Some resources that aren't dependent on nodes (e.g. general metrics across instances/account) may be included
  // by default, which can be explicitly disabled.
  billing: { enabled: false },
  ec2: { enabled: false },
  elasticCache: { enabled: false },
});
```
